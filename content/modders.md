title: For Modders
---

**Fealty** is being built from the ground up to be as moddable as possible. 

We expose _almost_ every detail about the game, except parts of the core simulation, in **XML** files to make them easily modifiable. If you have not worked with data like this before, the volume of it can be a little overwhelming - but fear not! 

Part of our release and support plan is to embed a data editor straight into the game client itself. This should make the community content development easy and fun.

Our hope is to make mods easy to create, share, and use. We believe that a community that can be directly involved with the creative and design aspects of the game is going to produce ideas that _we_ haven't even dreamed of, and increase the likelihood of this game being something meaningful and fun to as many people as possible.

We plan to reveal more about how moddable the game is once we have a public release and **YOU** can start contributing to the game!
