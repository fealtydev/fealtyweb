Where does the time go?

Like I promised some time ago, this post will be about the core military units in Fealty and their function. However, before we get into that here is a brief announcement:

    The game is moving closer towards the release of 1.4.0. I still have some UI pieces and text strings to improve ( a lot actually ) before then, but the release is feature complete at this point. 

    I made a special "**playtest**" build that I would like to get feedback on so I can roll-up any more changes for the release build.

    I am specifically looking for feedback around numbers

    * population growth
    * building construction times
    * etc

    Thank you for your help!

Moving on!
