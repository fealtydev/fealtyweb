title: Update #1 - Introduction

Welcome to the *Fealty* website!

We are launching this site on a very important day - the first bits of *Fealty* code were written exactly one year ago! It has been an exciting and humbling ride, even at this early stage of developing the game, and now the time has finally come to reveal it to the world. We are very happy to have you with us!

Today I want to describe my vision for the game and talk about what we are planning for the next few months. My intention is to post here two times a month, in between our development milestones, with the idea of sharing our progress with you early and often. The concept behind *Fealty* is unique and challenging from a design perspective, and a big part of the decision to start sharing the development of the game was to make it possible for people to see the game and give us feedback.

At the center of *Fealty* are the concepts of **Loyalty** and **Duties**. Historically, feudal society was organized around plots of land called **Fiefs**. A noble, who was someone that claim to land, would divide it and give it out to their followers - also known as **Vassals**. In this way the noble was responsible for providing for the livelihood of their vassals - a place to live, a place to work, and security from enemies. These vassals, in turn, would owe the noble **Service** - both economical (e.g. working the land) and military (e.g. responding to the noble's call to arms to defeat an invader). These bidirectional relationships between vassal and liege are at the heart of the social interactions in the game.

The core of *Fealty* is the management of your fief, and the characters that inhabit it. Similar to other city-building games, you will allocate jobs, gather and refine resources, and recruit and interact with a wide variety of characters with their owns **Skills** and **Traits**.  Skills determine how a character can contribute to your fief, and Traits impact their behavior and ambitions. The sort of interesting choices we want players to face come from how Skills and Traits interact. It is exciting when a new Blacksmith approaches you to ask to join your fief. However, you might have to reconsider if they are not trustworthy, or are likely to cause trouble for the other inhabitants of your fief.

The past year of development has been focused on the core fief simulation. (I will expand on this soon, when I deep-dive into how our code is architected) The goal of our design is to provide a data-driven and extensible engine that can provide emergent gameplay from the discreet simulation of character actions, needs, and motivations. Our efforts were validated early in December 2018, when, with a great part of the simulation in place, we were able to quickly add content to the game (including new jobs, crafting recipes, and resource chains). 

At this point the game has some of our own art, but much of it is still open-sourced stuff and developer art. The UI is also functional, but not pretty. Our focus for the next couple of months is to replace all the art we can, improve the UI to better surface the stuff going on in the sim, and then ... share our first demo with you!

I hope you enjoyed reading a little bit about our game - we will share more news and content updates as they happen, so stay tuned!
