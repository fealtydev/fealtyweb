title: Alpha 1 is getting pretty damn close
---

Well, people, I have been writing lots of code for about a month. Almost exactly a month, actually - the first commit was 24 March 2019. Over the past month the project has achieved a very important milestone - it is playable! Like, holy shit, its hideous and ugly, but there is a *nugget* of an experience here!

Allright, so what is going to be in this release?

The goal of Alpha 1 is to capture the low-level interactions around controlling Settlements. Settlements are important because they give your dynasty Power and all that power you accumulate during the game will get added to your dynasty's Prestige at the end.

Now that we have gone over the concept and our design goals, we are turning our full attention to the Kingdom Game. Next time we will talk about the Kingdom Game prototype design, and our roadmap for the near future.
