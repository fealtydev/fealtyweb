title: Alpha 1 Post Mortem and What's Next
tags: postmortem
---

I am already well on my way working on improvements and new stuff for the next release. Before the moment gets away from us, I wanted to do a brief post mortem on the release.

## Post Mortem

### The Good

#### It exists

The most important thing about Alpha 1 is that it exists. It was important for me to put something together as soon as possible and to adopt an iterative production process

#### People played it

That's motivating!

#### Got some feedback

The feedback channels are working. Between the in-game reporting stuff and direct messages from people I received great feedback on what was confusing, what felt good, and the impression that people got from the game

### The Bad

#### Some breaking bugs still made it through testing

Despite all the bugs found in playtest, 2 severe crash bugs still made it to live. Sorry about that :C

#### No iOS release because of platform specific bugs

iOS specific issues are some-what of a bane to me because I don't have an iOS device. Fixing and finding bugs is a lot of trial and error and reading logs. I decided to let the iOS build sit broken while I focused on improving the PC UI instead

#### The UI tries to serve three masters (PC, Portrait, and Landscape) and in the end does none of them well

As an "always-on" game, Fealty caters directly to mobile devices - but most of the testers were PC users. This is a tough split between crowds, and I am striving to find a balance between building UI for them. I might just ditch portrait mode

### The Ugly

#### The game is fairly boring and obtuse

This didn't surprise me - I have the advantage( or disadvantage?) of having the entire model of the game in my head. So I have an idea of how small things will impact big things. I am finding communicating this sort of information, and relationships between information, to be one of the more challenging aspects of gamedev

## What's Next

The focus for the next release is three fold

1) Add dynasty & character creation/modification
2) Make the minute-to-minute Kingdom Game more engaging
3) Improve the tutorial/advisor experience

### Dynasty & Character Creation

Alpha 1 was mostly about the core of the kingdom game - specifically the core character actions around
