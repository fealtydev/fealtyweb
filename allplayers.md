**Fealty** is a strategy game layer over a role-playing sim. What the hell does that mean?

The easiest explanation is to take the strategy of **Crusader Kings 2** and layer it over something like **Dwarf Fortress** or **Rimworld**. Then add a dash of **The Sims**, **Stronghold** and **Banished**. Sort of.

The first thing you will do is to create your character and their backstory. This will define your [character's] personality traits and skills, your lineage, and some other things that play into the events of the world and its progression. You will define not only who you are, but your place in the world.

You play the role of a young noble with a humble humble village to call your own. Your land will be peopled by stoic and hardworking (most of the time) peasants, skilled yeomen responsible for producing goods and enhancing village life, and warriors (some of them noble Knights, others... less noble).

Your vassals have their own ambitions, goals, and motives - you must do your best to prod them in the right direction. 

You will manage the day-to-day affairs of your village from your manor. The manor is the heart of your territory, literally your seat of power. Your advisors (you do have some, right?) will try their best to help you to lead and grow your people to create a thriving and powerful  realm.

Visitors also will come to visit your court; to tell you their tale, to ask you for things, as well as share stories about whats going on beyond your little realm. How you interact with them could have wide-ranging impacts - your neighbors will hear about _YOUR_ decisions as well.

As your growing realm comes into contact with other Lords, your challenges will grow. Are they trustworthy? Should you trade with them? Or just befriend and betray them - before they betray you? Getting information about the outside world, and being able to trust it, will be one of the many skills you will have to develop. 

In Fealty real power comes from players working together to achieve more than is possible by one Lord. Whether you are a vassal, or have vassals yourself, you will need trustworthy and stalwart allies to fulfill your destiny. You will bring your closest and most trusted allies into your Court, where they will witness the day-to-day going ons in your fief, and send them on sensitive and important missions. Perhaps news of your greatness will spread to other fiefs by a travelling merchant, or that annoying minstrel you allow to visit your court from time to time.

Regardless of what happens, you will imprint **YOUR STORY** on a real and breathing world. 

What kind of story will you forge?
