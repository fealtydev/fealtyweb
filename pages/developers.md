**Fealty** is a complicated piece of software architecture. Some of this complexity is inherent to this type of game (deep and layered simulation, many interacting parts), but there is more to it than that.

From the beginning we saw **Fealty** as a gateway into a world. Besides the [moddability](./modders.html) we are building into the game, we have also designed the game client to be completely replacable.


What does this mean?

This means that once you have the game in your hands you can build your own client that implements the **FealtySDK**!



This will open countless doors to our community:


* Don't like 2d sprite graphics? Change the client to use 3d models, or make your own client!

* Want different animations? Add a (better) animation system to the game, or make your own client!

* Hate graphics altogether and want text? ASCII art? ... FINE!

* Wondering how our horrid UI ever came to be? Change it! Or make your own!




You get the idea.


Only the core sim engine needs to be locked down (to prevent cheating, support multiplayer sync, and such), but the rest of it is fair game.
