title: About 5th Power Games
---

**5th PG** is a small independent game studio working on their first title, **Fealty**. 

The studio is made up of five siblings that have known each other their entire lives. Originally, _Fealty_ was the love-child of a single developer who persistently shared his progress with the only people that would listen - the family. As things got serious, the siblings wanted to get it on it too. And it turned out that, together, we covered a lot of the disciplines necessary to make this thing a reality. 

The original single developer is still our only developer, but he is legendary for creating horrid UI and doesn't know squat about music. Fortunately, two of the siblings are talented pixel artists, and another knows a thing or two about music composition. The fifth sibling had spent a career in finance, and later education - which turned out to be great preparation for crunching numbers and developing maff formulas, and to provide insight in hwo to communicate the game concepts in-game.

Once we united our efforts it became clear to us that we had a real shot at making **Fealty** a success. 

Our dream is to get this game into as many hands as possible, so that we can all ditch our _real_ jobs and devote all our attention and time to growing what we think is a unique gaming experience not available anywhere else.
