Settlements can be taken over through sieges. A siege lasts until the sieging army or the settlement runs out of **Food** or **Troops**.

When a settlement is under siege the Farmers are not able to plant crops or harvest food. Additionally, characters in the settlement cannot leave it.

During each round of negotiation, the sieging character can:

* Incite - Increase unrest in the settlement

* Pillage - Destroy some of the settlement's planted crops

* Poison - Destroy some of the settlement's Food

* Assault - Attack the settlement to conquer it outright
