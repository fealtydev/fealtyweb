## Manor

The manor is the residence of the Lord. Workers assigned to the manor represent servants of the Lord helping to make the settlement more efficient. The manor grants a bonus to most of the activities of the settlement.

## Cottage

Cottages provide homes for the settlement population. Workers assigned to a cottage contribute to the growth of the population of the settlement. A shortage of cottages will impair the growth of the settlement.

## Market

Markets enable the population of the settlement to trade. Workers assigned to a market produce **Coin** every day.

## Tavern

Taverns allow the recruitment of **Mercenaries**. Workers assigned to taverns increase the rate at which mercenaries become available. More Taverns allows for a greater number of mercenaries to be available at a time.
