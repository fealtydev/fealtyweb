# Overview

Settlements are important because they produce the core resources of **Population**, **Food**, and **Coin**.

Most settlements are **Neutral** at the beginning of the game and can be sieged or annexed. A character can take control of a settlement and become the [Lord](lords) there.

---

## Taking Control

Settlements can begin the game as **Neutral** or controlled by a dynasty.

* A character can take control of a settlement with the **Siege** action. 
* **Neutral** settlements can be 'peacefully' taken over with the **Annex** action.
* When a character completes a succesful **Siege** or **Annex** action they become the new Lord of the settlement.

## Population

Population is the most important resource because without people you won't be able to do much else. The settlement population can be Farmers, or Workers.

### Farmers

Farmers are the part of your population not doing anything else. [Farming](farming) is year-round work, except for Winter, with a harvest in the spring and in the late fall. You need to make sure each settlement has enough farmers available not only for planting crops throughout the year, but especially at harvest time before the planted crops will go to waste. 

Farmers can be transferred to characters or assigned to buildings at any time.

### Workers

Workers is the catch all terms for the population assigned to [Buildings](buildings) in a settlement.

Workers cannot be transferred to characters, but can be unassigned from their building.

### Growth

Settlement population growth occurs once a game day. The rate of growth is affected by the current population, cottage space available, cottage workers and manor workers.

## Food

Food is consumed by the settlement population once a game day. A lack of Food can lead to Unrest problems.

## Unrest

Unrest is primarily affected by food supply, but it can also be affected when a settlement is under siege. A settlement that reaches 100 **Unrest** will kick their Lord out and open its doors.

## Farming

Farming occurs 

The farming cycle occurs in three phases: Planting, Harvesting, and Winter

### Planting

A settlement will plant food equal to the number of available Farmers modified by a scalar


### Harvesting

During the harvest months (March, October) farmers extract the planted food and store it in the settlement

### Winter

During the winter months Farmers get a break! Use them to build things, or put them in an army to get ready for the spring campaign
