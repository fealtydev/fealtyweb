## Attributes

### Morale

When a character has Troops, the Morale of the Troops will slowly build each day. Morale growth slows as it increases until it reaches the limit of 100

#### Base Morale Change

>| Morale Value  | Base Change  |
>|:-:|:-:|
>| 0-25  | 5 |
>| 26-50  | 3 |
>| 51-75  | 2 |
>| 76-100  | 1 |

#### Food Shortage

If there is not enough Food to feed all the Troops, Morale will decrease instead. This can happen very quickly, specially if there are many troops!
