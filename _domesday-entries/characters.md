## Attributes

### Age

* A character's age increases during the Kingdom Game on their birth day and month

### Honor

* Character's gain Honor primarily when they are Lords of a Settlement, but also as a result of actions

* Character Honor is converted to Dynasty Prestige at the end of the Kingdom Game

### Troops & Food

* Characters can be assigned Troops from the settlement population.

* A character with Troops consumes Food daily

### Food & Morale

When a character has Troops, the Morale of the Troops will slowly increase each day as long as the army has Food. Morale growth slows as it increases until it reaches the limit of 100.

If there is not enough Food to feed all the Troops, Morale will decrease instead. This can happen very quickly, specially if there are many troops!
