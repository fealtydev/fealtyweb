## Changelog

### Features

* **Live Mode**
  * The game will now simulate the passage of time since you last played
  * This is enabled by default, but can be turned off in the Options menu
* Characters will emote as they begin and complete actions (WIP)
* Option to enable/disable the Advisor and the Tutorial
* Added basic account management functionality (still using the fake local server)

### Changes

* **Simulation Changes**
  * The game simulates one hour of gametime per tick at a customizable rate (currently 10 seconds per tick)
  * Actions are interpolated during the 10 second interval to represent continual progress
  * You can adjust the tick interval in the options
* Disable Sound effects by default (can be toggled in Options)
* Tweaks to UI in many places, you can drag many of the UI elements now
* Simplified the UI look - I think it was to distracting before, and too rich - its all temporary

### Fixes

* Characters that are already moving when the game starts will be correctly placed on the map
* Fixed numerous UI related crashes
